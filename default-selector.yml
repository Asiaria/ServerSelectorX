# You only need to specify 'ip' and 'port' if 'show-player-count' is set to true.

# If you wish to send a link to the player instead of teleporting them to a server, prefix the link with 'url:'
# For example:
# server: 'url:http://example.com/'

# Number of rows of slots of your server selector menu. For example '2' will mean 2*9 = 18 slots. Max value is 6.
rows: 2

# This will be displayed as the title of the menu.
