# It is recommended that you configure your firewall so that only your Minecraft servers have access to 
# the ServerSelectorX API (running on the port configured above). In that case, you do not need to
# worry about setting a password.
# If for some reason the ServerSelectorX port has to be open, you should set a password.
# Please note that, since the API uses standard HTTP, there is no encryption so someone who
# is able to perform a MITM attack will be able to get the password.
#
# TL;DR: The SSX port should not be accessible externally, and you don't need to worry about this password
