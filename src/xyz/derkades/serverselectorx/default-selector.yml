# Number of rows of slots of your server selector menu. For example '2' will mean 2*9 = 18 slots. Max value is 6.
rows: 2

# This will be displayed as the title of the menu.
title: 'Server Selector'

# The name of the server selector item. Specify "NONE" for no item.
item: COMPASS

# Give the item when a player joins?
on-join: true

# What slot should the item be in?
inv-slot: 0

# URL clickable message
url-message: '&3&lClick here'

# Command to open the menu. Specify "none" for no command. (without /)
command: "menu"



# You only need to specify 'ip' and 'port' if 'show-player-count' is set to true.
# In order to show play count text you need to put {playercount} somewhere in your lore.

# If you wish to send a link to the player instead of teleporting them to a server, prefix the link with 'url:'
# For example:
# server: 'url:http://example.com/'
#
# You can also force the player to send a command. The player will need permission for this command. 
# No / before the command. (so for worldedit commands just one)
# Prefix the command with 'cmd:', for example:
# server: 'cmd:gamemode 1'
#
# If that's not enough, you can even open a new server selector. This can be used for submenus.
# You need to create a new server selector first, do that making a copy of this file in the same directory then modifying it.
# Prefix the selector name with 'sel' for example:
# server: 'sel:uhc-servers'
