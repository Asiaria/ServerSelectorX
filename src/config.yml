# -------------------- Server Pinging -------------------- #

# Use an external query API for pinging servers. This is recommended.
# The internal query has a lot of problems, one of which is that it doesn't work when there are color codes anywhere in the lore. Version support is terrible as well.
# If you have your spigot servers behind a firewall (which you should) allow the domain api.minetools.eu to ping your server.
external-query: true

# Whether servers should be pinged in the background.
# When disabled, all servers are pinged when the server selector opens. This can cause delays of several seconds.
# Only turn this off if it is causing lag or your internet connection can't handle it.
background-pinging: true

# How long a server needs to be pinged for before giving up. (in milliseconds)
# Set this to a higher value if your servers are not responding in time.
# This setting has effect on the internal query only.
ping-timeout: 500

# Cooldown for opening the selector menu in milliseconds.
# This can be used as workaround for a bug where players are able to take out items if they
# click the selector again while it is still waiting for servers to be pinged from the first time they clicked.
# You will probably only need this if you have background-pinging set to off.
# This value is in milliseconds. Any value less than 1000 = cooldown off.
selector-open-cooldown: 0

# Specify empty string for no message -> cooldown-message: ''
