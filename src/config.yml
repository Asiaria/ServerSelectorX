# -------------------- Server Pinging -------------------- #

# Use an external query API for pinging servers. This is recommended.
# Only use the internal query if your servers are behind a firewall and not publicly accessible, or the external query API is down.
# The internal query has a lot of problems, one of which is that it doesn't work when there are color codes anywhere in the lore.

# How long a server needs to be pinged for before giving up. (in milliseconds)
# Set this to a higher value if your servers are not responding in time.
# This setting has effect on the internal query only.
ping-timeout: 500

# Cooldown for opening the selector menu in milliseconds.
# This should be equal or greater than ping-timeout * servers
# where servers = the number of servers that have server pinging enabled.
# This is a temporary solution for a complicated problem, which should be fixed soon.
