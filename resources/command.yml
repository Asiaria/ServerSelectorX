# Note when making changes to command names without restarting the server:
#
# /ssx reload does not reload command properties (command name, aliases, 
# description, usage). It does reload does reload actions, permissions, etc.
#
# /ssx reloadcommands loads new commands. If you change a command name or add
# a new command, you will be able to use it with the new command name. The old
# command will still work. Reloading aliases, command description and usage is
# not supported. Restart the server.



# Actions to perform when the command is executed
actions:
  - 'openmenu:serverselector' # Open default menu (config file in ../menu/default.yml)

# Require the permission ssx.command.<command> to run the command
# This command is called 'servers' so the permission ssx.command.servers would be required.
permission: false

aliases:
 - 'menu'
